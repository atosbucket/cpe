"""Manage Yo notifications

This tool helps schedule yo notifications. It solves several problems
for administrators.

First, it ensures that the proper application context is available prior
to attempting to run the yo binary, which will fail if not run as the
current console user.

The scheduler ensures that any notification is delivered at least once
to each user. If they are not logged in when configured, the
notification will be delivered immediately after their next login.

Admins may specify a date after which notifications are no-longer
considered deliverable, ensuring notifications aren't delivered to
infrequently used accounts long-past their freshness date.

Likewise, a list of accounts for which delivering notifications should
be skipped may be specified on a per-notification and a global basis.

Normally, the tool must be run as root. For testing purposes,  you may
trigger a notification for the current console user by running this tool
with that user's account.

Unless cleared, the `com.sheagcraig.yo` preference domain caches
all notifications so that they may be delivered to any user of the
system without foreknowledge of their username, infinitely into the
future. The yo_scheduler includes a flag to clear cached notifications
while retaining any other preferences.
